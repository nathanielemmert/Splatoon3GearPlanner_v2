/* 
TODO: Add the createGearCategory() logic into this file, using stores similar to createGear.svelte.ts.

1. Anywhere that manually creates a gearCategory by assigning an object like let gearCategory = {...} should be replaced by a function from this file.

2. I should make gear categories use reactive stores or state. So that way when i remove a gear from a category, the wvelte page updates properly.

3. All logic related to gear categories should be contained in this file, not sprinkled in svelte components.
    - For example, the InputGearCategory file has alot of functions related to gear categories like removeGear and addGearToCategory.
    - Those functions should all be moved to this file in some way. probably by making gearCategory a class, or exporting those functions in some other way.
